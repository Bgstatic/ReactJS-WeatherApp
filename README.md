 ## About the App
 
 This app is a basic weather app which can display current weather based on user's input or default input (set default to the 'London'). I have used WeatherStack-API for the getting weather information and for the images of places, used Unplash-API. For design and layout part I have inspired from [Arthur K's](https://dribbble.com/shots/7376567-Weather-App-Website) weather app design. You can also take a look at his designs from [here](https://dribbble.com/thearthurk).

## Restrictions

Due to the free version of the WeatherStack-API I have used the http based api which has not a security certificate, I cannot deploy the app properly. I am working on deploy from other hosting firms lately. As soon as I deploy, I will share the link of the project.
