 ## About the App
 
 This app is a basic weather app which can display current weather based on user's input or default input (set default to the 'London'). I have used WeatherStack-API for the getting weather information and for the images of places, used Unplash-API. For design and layout part I have inspired from [Arthur K's](https://dribbble.com/thearthurk)
